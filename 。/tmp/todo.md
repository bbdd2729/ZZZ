# Character Switching System Implementation Plan

## Current Status
✅ Analyzed PlayerManager.cs - basic framework exists
✅ Found supporting systems: PlayerController.cs, GameEvents.cs, StateMachine.cs
⏳ Need to create ScriptableObject for character data
⏳ Need to implement state switching logic
⏳ Need to optimize state machine implementation

## Next Steps
1. Create CharacterData ScriptableObject and related infrastructure
2. Implement player spawning and management in PlayerManager
3. Create SwitchOutState for character exit transitions
4. Test and optimize the switching system

## Implementation Progress
[Detailed implementation follows...]
